# STAT305 Probability and Statistics for Engineers (Fall 2020)
## Course Description
This course aims to make the students aware of the basic concepts of descriptive and inferential statistics and discusses the following topics: data types and data sources, presenting data in charts and tables, measures of location and variability, the basic concept of probabilities, random variables and probability distributions, mathematical expectation, some discrete and continuous distributions, simple linear regression mode and correlation. The course also gives a general overview and foundations for statistical inference. The practical session aims to make students able to solve mathematical exercises using mathematical software such as SPSS, Minitab and R.
## Course Objectives
After completing this course the student will be able to:
* Examine statistical data and methods of collecting, representing and organizing it.
* Identify measures of location and variability.
* Determine the basic concepts of probabilities.
* Apply the random variables and probability distributions and its properties
* Apply different types of distributions.
* Compute probabilities from some discrete and continuous distributions .
* Carry out confidence interval calculations.
* Perform statistical hypothesis tests.
* Apply methods of how to compute relationships between variables.
* Use the available statistical software to improve knowledge about probability.
* Apply problem solving skill, critical thinking and group working
